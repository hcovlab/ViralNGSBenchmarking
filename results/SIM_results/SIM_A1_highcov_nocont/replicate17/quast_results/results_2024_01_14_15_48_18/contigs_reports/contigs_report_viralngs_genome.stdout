CONTIG: None (8608bp)
Best alignment score: 3448.1 (LEN: 3585, IDY: 96.18), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7835.2, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 561
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 17 3619 | 1 3585 | 3603 3585 | 96.18 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 3908 4590 | 3874 4553 | 683 680 | 98.35 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 4745 6223 | 4708 6183 | 1479 1476 | 99.25 | EMBOSS_001 None
