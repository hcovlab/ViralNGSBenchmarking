CONTIG: None (8530bp)
Best alignment score: 7885.4 (LEN: 7937, IDY: 99.35), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8359.4, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 113
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 2 7965 | 1 7937 | 7964 7937 | 99.35 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -13 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 8079 8561 | 8051 8530 | 483 480 | 99.79 | EMBOSS_001 None
