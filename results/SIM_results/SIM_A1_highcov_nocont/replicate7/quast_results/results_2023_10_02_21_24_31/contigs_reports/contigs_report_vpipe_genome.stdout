CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8635bp)
Best alignment score: 5785.0 (LEN: 5817, IDY: 99.45), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8297.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 215
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5833 | 1 5817 | 5833 5817 | 99.45 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -169 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6033 8641 | 6014 8616 | 2609 2603 | 97.43 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
