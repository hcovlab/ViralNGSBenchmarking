CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8641bp)
Best alignment score: 5794.3 (LEN: 5817, IDY: 99.61), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8289.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 208
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5836 | 1 5817 | 5836 5817 | 99.61 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -162 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6023 8629 | 6007 8622 | 2607 2616 | 96.28 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
