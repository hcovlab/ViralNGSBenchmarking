CONTIG: None (8569bp)
Best alignment score: 3718.1 (LEN: 3787, IDY: 98.18), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7364.9, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 1040
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 27 3783 | 1 3742 | 3757 3742 | 97.59 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -1014 (extensive)
			Real Alignment 2: 4833 8637 | 4783 8569 | 3805 3787 | 98.18 | EMBOSS_001 None
