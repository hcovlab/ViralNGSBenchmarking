CONTIG: None (8595bp)
Best alignment score: 7860.8 (LEN: 7871, IDY: 99.87), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8342.8, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 237
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 7910 | 1 7871 | 7910 7871 | 99.87 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -237 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 8148 8634 | 8109 8595 | 487 487 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
