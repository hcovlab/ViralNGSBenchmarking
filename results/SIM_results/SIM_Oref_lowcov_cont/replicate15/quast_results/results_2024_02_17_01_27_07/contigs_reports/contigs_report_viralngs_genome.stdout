CONTIG: None (8591bp)
Best alignment score: 4680.5 (LEN: 4704, IDY: 99.50), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8208.6, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 340
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 4716 | 1 4704 | 4716 4704 | 99.5 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 3 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 4930 7744 | 4915 7726 | 2815 2812 | 99.79 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
