CONTIG: None (8695bp)
Best alignment score: 3859.6 (LEN: 3901, IDY: 98.94), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7720.5, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 896
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 158 | 1 158 | 158 158 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 3 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 335 4247 | 332 4232 | 3913 3901 | 98.94 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 3 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 4624 4942 | 4606 4924 | 319 319 | 99.37 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
