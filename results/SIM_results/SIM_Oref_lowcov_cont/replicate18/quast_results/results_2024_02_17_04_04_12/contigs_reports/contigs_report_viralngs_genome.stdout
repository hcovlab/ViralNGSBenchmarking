CONTIG: None (8688bp)
Best alignment score: 4663.9 (LEN: 4684, IDY: 99.57), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7679.7, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 960
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 4693 | 1 4684 | 4693 4684 | 99.57 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 4920 5210 | 4911 5201 | 291 291 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 5703 7671 | 5694 7653 | 1969 1960 | 99.48 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 1 (local)
