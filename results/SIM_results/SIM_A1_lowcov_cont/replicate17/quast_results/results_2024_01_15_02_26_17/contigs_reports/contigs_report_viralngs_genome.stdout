CONTIG: None (8043bp)
Best alignment score: 3968.2 (LEN: 4036, IDY: 98.32), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7376.6, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 564
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 161 410 | 1 250 | 250 250 | 99.6 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 538 3745 | 378 3570 | 3208 3193 | 99.26 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
