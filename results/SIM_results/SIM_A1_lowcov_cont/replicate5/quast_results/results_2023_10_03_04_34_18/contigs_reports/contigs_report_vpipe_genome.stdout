			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7776.1, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 727
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5833 | 1 5820 | 5833 5820 | 98.37 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -3
			Real Alignment 2: 6026 6367 | 6016 6357 | 342 342 | 99.12 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -12
			Real Alignment 3: 6645 7407 | 6647 7409 | 763 763 | 97.38 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Indel (<= 5bp) between these two alignments: deletion of length 3; 0 mismatches (number of Ns: 0)
			Real Alignment 4: 7411 8106 | 7410 8105 | 696 696 | 97.56 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Indel (> 5bp) between these two alignments: insertion of length 6; 70 mismatches (number of Ns: 0)
