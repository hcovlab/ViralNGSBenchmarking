CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8641bp)
Best alignment score: 5741.4 (LEN: 5820, IDY: 98.65), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8213.9, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 211
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5824 | 1 5820 | 5824 5820 | 98.65 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -168 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6017 8611 | 6016 8625 | 2595 2610 | 95.65 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
