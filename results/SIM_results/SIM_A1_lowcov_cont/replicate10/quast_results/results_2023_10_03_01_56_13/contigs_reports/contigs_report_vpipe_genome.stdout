CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8638bp)
Best alignment score: 5759.3 (LEN: 5814, IDY: 99.06), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8230.2, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 214
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5839 | 1 5814 | 5839 5814 | 99.06 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -168 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6032 8629 | 6010 8619 | 2598 2610 | 95.59 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
