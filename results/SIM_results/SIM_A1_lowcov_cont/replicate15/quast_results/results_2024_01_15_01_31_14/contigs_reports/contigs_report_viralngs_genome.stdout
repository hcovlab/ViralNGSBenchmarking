			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8456.2, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 102
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 12 484 | 1 473 | 473 473 | 99.79 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -91 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 587 8639 | 576 8610 | 8053 8035 | 99.43 | EMBOSS_001 None
