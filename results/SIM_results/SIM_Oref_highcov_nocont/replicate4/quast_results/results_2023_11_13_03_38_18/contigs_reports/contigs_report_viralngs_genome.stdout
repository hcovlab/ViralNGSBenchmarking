CONTIG: None (8802bp)
Best alignment score: 2915.5 (LEN: 2934, IDY: 99.37), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8056.4, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 666
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 1224 | 1 1221 | 1224 1221 | 99.26 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1572 4511 | 1569 4502 | 2940 2934 | 99.37 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 4619 7173 | 4610 7152 | 2555 2543 | 99.35 | EMBOSS_001 None
