CONTIG: None (8736bp)
Best alignment score: 7674.3 (LEN: 7751, IDY: 99.01), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8504.3, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 132
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 7754 | 1 7751 | 7754 7751 | 99.01 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -129 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 7884 8739 | 7881 8733 | 856 853 | 97.89 | EMBOSS_001 None
