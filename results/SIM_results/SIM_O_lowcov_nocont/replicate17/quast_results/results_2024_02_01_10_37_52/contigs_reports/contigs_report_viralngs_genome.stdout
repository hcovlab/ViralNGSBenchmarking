CONTIG: None (5292bp)
Best alignment score: 3697.1 (LEN: 3703, IDY: 99.84), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4787.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 488
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 113 | 1 113 | 113 113 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 386 1376 | 392 1379 | 991 988 | 99.9 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -9 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1578 5295 | 1590 5292 | 3718 3703 | 99.84 | EMBOSS_001 None
