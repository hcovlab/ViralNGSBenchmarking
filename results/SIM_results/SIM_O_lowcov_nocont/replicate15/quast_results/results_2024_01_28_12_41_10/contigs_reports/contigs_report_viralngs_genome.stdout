CONTIG: None (7169bp)
Best alignment score: 3734.0 (LEN: 3734, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5520.0, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1629
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 144 | 1 144 | 144 144 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 382 1391 | 388 1397 | 1010 1010 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1539 5275 | 1557 5290 | 3737 3734 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
