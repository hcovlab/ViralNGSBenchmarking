CONTIG: None (7165bp)
Best alignment score: 3717.0 (LEN: 3717, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5238.0, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 1912
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 140 | 1 140 | 140 140 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 385 1390 | 391 1396 | 1006 1006 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -9 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1555 5274 | 1570 5286 | 3720 3717 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 12 (local)
