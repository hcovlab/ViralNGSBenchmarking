CONTIG: None (4864bp)
Best alignment score: 1348.0 (LEN: 1353, IDY: 99.63), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4070.0, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 759
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 419 1398 | 1 971 | 980 971 | 99.79 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1560 2731 | 1145 2313 | 1172 1169 | 99.23 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 2927 4282 | 2509 3861 | 1356 1353 | 99.63 | EMBOSS_001 None
