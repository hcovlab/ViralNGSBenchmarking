CONTIG: None (5264bp)
Best alignment score: 3678.8 (LEN: 3688, IDY: 99.75), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4797.8, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 444
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 146 | 1 140 | 146 140 | 99.29 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -3 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 397 1397 | 394 1385 | 1001 992 | 99.8 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1577 5279 | 1577 5264 | 3703 3688 | 99.75 | EMBOSS_001 None
