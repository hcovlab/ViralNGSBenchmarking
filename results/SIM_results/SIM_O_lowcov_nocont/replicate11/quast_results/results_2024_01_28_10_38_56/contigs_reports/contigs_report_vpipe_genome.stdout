CONTIG: currsample-currdate (8624bp)
Best alignment score: 683.1 (LEN: 705, IDY: 96.89), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 892.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 7710
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 914 out of 8624 non-N bases (10.60%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8624 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 914
