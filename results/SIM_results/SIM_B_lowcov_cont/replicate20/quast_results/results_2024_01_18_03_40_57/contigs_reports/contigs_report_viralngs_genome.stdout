CONTIG: None (8593bp)
Best alignment score: 3677.8 (LEN: 3683, IDY: 99.86), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8129.0, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 428
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 3689 | 1 3683 | 3689 3683 | 99.86 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 3976 5367 | 3970 5352 | 1392 1383 | 99.41 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
