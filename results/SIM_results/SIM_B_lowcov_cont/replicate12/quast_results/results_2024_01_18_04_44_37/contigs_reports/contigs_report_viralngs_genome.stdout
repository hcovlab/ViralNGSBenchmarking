CONTIG: None (8608bp)
Best alignment score: 6949.7 (LEN: 7080, IDY: 98.16), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8284.7, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 169
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 1374 | 1 1359 | 1374 1359 | 98.6 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -169 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1544 8638 | 1529 8608 | 7095 7080 | 98.16 | EMBOSS_001 None
