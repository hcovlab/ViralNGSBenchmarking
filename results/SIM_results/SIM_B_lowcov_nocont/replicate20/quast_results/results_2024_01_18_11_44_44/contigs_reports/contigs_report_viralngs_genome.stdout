CONTIG: None (8361bp)
Best alignment score: 1864.4 (LEN: 1930, IDY: 96.60), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 2987.3, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 5286
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 3075 out of 6681 non-N bases (46.03%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8361 (number of Ns: 1680) and total length of all aligns is 3075
