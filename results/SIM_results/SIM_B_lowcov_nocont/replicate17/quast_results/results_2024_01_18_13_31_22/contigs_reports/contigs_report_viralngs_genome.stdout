CONTIG: None (8605bp)
Best alignment score: 4740.0 (LEN: 4759, IDY: 99.60), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8295.6, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 265
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 4 4774 | 4 4762 | 4771 4759 | 99.6 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -259 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 5037 8623 | 5025 8605 | 3587 3581 | 99.43 | EMBOSS_001 None
