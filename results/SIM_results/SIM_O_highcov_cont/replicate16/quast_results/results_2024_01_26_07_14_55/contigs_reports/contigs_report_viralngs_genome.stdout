CONTIG: None (5219bp)
Best alignment score: 1484.0 (LEN: 1493, IDY: 99.40), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4120.0, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1026
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 7 145 | 7 145 | 139 139 | 97.84 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 398 1263 | 404 1260 | 866 857 | 97.55 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1601 2755 | 1610 2761 | 1155 1152 | 98.7 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
