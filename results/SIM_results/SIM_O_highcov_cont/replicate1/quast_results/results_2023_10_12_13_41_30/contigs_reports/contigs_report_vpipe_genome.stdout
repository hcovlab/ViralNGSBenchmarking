CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8625bp)
Best alignment score: 841.0 (LEN: 851, IDY: 98.83), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 1321.0, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 7294
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1331 out of 8625 non-N bases (15.43%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8625 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1331
