CONTIG: None (7163bp)
Best alignment score: 3670.1 (LEN: 3683, IDY: 99.65), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5453.1, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1675
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 144 | 1 144 | 144 144 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 382 1394 | 388 1397 | 1013 1010 | 99.9 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1543 5231 | 1558 5240 | 3689 3683 | 99.65 | EMBOSS_001 None
