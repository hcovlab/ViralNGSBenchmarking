CONTIG: None (5294bp)
Best alignment score: 2666.0 (LEN: 2761, IDY: 96.56), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4149.2, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1010
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 145 | 1 145 | 145 145 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 382 779 | 388 773 | 398 386 | 95.89 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 942 1407 | 936 1401 | 466 466 | 99.57 | EMBOSS_001 None
