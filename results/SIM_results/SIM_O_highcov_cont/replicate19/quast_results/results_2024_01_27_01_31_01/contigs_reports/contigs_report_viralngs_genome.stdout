CONTIG: None (5293bp)
Best alignment score: 1401.0 (LEN: 1403, IDY: 99.86), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4051.0, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1211
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 144 | 1 144 | 144 144 | 99.31 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 622 1331 | 616 1325 | 710 710 | 99.3 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -9 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1554 2759 | 1557 2756 | 1206 1200 | 99.83 | EMBOSS_001 None
