CONTIG: unknown_unknown_unknown_unknown_K03455.1_0_0_0_0 (1085bp)
Best alignment score: 698.0 (LEN: 698, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 852.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 223
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 164 | 1 164 | 164 164 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 unknown_unknown_unknown_unknown_K03455.1_0_0_0_0
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -220 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 382 1082 | 388 1085 | 701 698 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 unknown_unknown_unknown_unknown_K03455.1_0_0_0_0
