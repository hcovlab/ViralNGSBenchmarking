CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8647bp)
Best alignment score: 5721.6 (LEN: 5820, IDY: 98.31), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8193.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 217
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5827 | 1 5820 | 5827 5820 | 98.31 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -171 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6026 8623 | 6019 8628 | 2598 2610 | 95.61 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
