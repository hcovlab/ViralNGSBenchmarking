CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8639bp)
Best alignment score: 5741.3 (LEN: 5814, IDY: 98.75), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8208.8, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 209
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5839 | 1 5814 | 5839 5814 | 98.75 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -154 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6026 8626 | 6004 8619 | 2601 2616 | 95.24 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
