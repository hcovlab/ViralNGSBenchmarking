CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8635bp)
Best alignment score: 5736.1 (LEN: 5814, IDY: 98.66), Total number of alignments: 7
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 7 total alignments)
		This contig has several significant sets of alignments. [An ambiguously mapped contig]
		Using only the very best set (option --ambiguity-usage is set to "one").
			The best set is below. Score: 8000.0, number of alignments: 7, unaligned bases: 518
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5839 | 1 5814 | 5839 5814 | 98.66 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -3
			Real Alignment 2: 6032 6373 | 6010 6351 | 342 342 | 98.25 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Indel (<= 5bp) between these two alignments: insertion of length 3; 34 mismatches (number of Ns: 0)
