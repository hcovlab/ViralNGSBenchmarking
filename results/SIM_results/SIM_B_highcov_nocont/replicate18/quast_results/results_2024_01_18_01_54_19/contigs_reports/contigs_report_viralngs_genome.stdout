CONTIG: None (8605bp)
Best alignment score: 5942.2 (LEN: 6001, IDY: 99.02), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8170.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 357
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 6007 | 1 6001 | 6007 6001 | 99.02 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -357 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6368 8620 | 6359 8605 | 2253 2247 | 99.37 | EMBOSS_001 None
