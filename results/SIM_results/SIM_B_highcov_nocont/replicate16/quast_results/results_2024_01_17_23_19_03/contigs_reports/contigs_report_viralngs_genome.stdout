CONTIG: None (8605bp)
Best alignment score: 3468.2 (LEN: 3521, IDY: 98.50), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8032.2, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 321
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 5 3531 | 5 3525 | 3527 3521 | 98.5 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 3707 6994 | 3701 6985 | 3288 3285 | 96.32 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 7137 8614 | 7128 8605 | 1478 1478 | 95.39 | EMBOSS_001 None
