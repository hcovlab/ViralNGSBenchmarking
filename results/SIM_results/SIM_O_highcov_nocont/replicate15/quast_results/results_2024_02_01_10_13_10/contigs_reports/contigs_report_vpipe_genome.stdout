CONTIG: currsample-currdate (8624bp)
Best alignment score: 837.1 (LEN: 858, IDY: 97.56), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 1291.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 7312
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1312 out of 8624 non-N bases (15.21%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8624 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1312
