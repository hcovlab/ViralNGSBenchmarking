CONTIG: None (7166bp)
Best alignment score: 3734.9 (LEN: 3736, IDY: 99.97), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5508.9, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1627
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 145 | 1 145 | 145 145 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 383 1394 | 389 1394 | 1012 1006 | 99.11 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1542 5280 | 1554 5289 | 3739 3736 | 99.97 | EMBOSS_001 None
