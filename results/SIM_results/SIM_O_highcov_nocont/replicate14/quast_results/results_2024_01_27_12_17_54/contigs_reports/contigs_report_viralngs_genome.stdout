CONTIG: None (5431bp)
Best alignment score: 3721.9 (LEN: 3732, IDY: 99.73), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4961.9, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 445
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 387 1389 | 1 1003 | 1003 1003 | 99.6 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1541 5293 | 1167 4898 | 3753 3732 | 99.73 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -3 (local)
