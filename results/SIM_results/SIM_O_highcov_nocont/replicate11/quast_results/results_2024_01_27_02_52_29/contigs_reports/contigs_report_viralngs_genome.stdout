CONTIG: None (7163bp)
Best alignment score: 3736.0 (LEN: 3736, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5514.1, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1623
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 145 | 1 145 | 145 145 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 382 1392 | 388 1392 | 1011 1005 | 99.41 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1539 5280 | 1551 5286 | 3742 3736 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -3 (local)
