CONTIG: currsample-currdate (8624bp)
Best alignment score: 950.1 (LEN: 962, IDY: 98.76), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 1446.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 7164
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1460 out of 8624 non-N bases (16.93%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8624 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1460
