CONTIG: None (4878bp)
Best alignment score: 2960.1 (LEN: 2961, IDY: 99.97), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4539.0, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 317
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 412 1393 | 1 982 | 982 982 | 99.69 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1542 4511 | 1143 4103 | 2970 2961 | 99.97 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
