CONTIG: None (4644bp)
Best alignment score: 1417.0 (LEN: 1421, IDY: 99.72), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 3532.0, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1060
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 388 650 | 1 263 | 263 263 | 96.96 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 1 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 769 1107 | 381 716 | 339 336 | 96.13 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1542 2723 | 1151 2332 | 1182 1182 | 99.83 | EMBOSS_001 None
