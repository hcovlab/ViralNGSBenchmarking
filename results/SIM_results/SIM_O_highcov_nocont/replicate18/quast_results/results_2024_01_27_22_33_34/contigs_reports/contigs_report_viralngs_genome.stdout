CONTIG: None (5298bp)
Best alignment score: 1700.0 (LEN: 1707, IDY: 99.59), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4193.9, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 1054
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 459 1390 | 465 1396 | 932 932 | 98.49 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -3 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1635 2729 | 1644 2738 | 1095 1095 | 99.36 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -1 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 2905 4611 | 2915 4621 | 1707 1707 | 99.59 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
