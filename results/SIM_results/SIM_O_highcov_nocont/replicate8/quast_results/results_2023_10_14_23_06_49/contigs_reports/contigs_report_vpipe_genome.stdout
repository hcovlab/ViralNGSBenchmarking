CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8625bp)
Best alignment score: 704.1 (LEN: 730, IDY: 96.45), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 913.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 7686
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 939 out of 8625 non-N bases (10.89%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8625 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 939
