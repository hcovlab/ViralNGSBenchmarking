CONTIG: currsample-currdate (8627bp)
Best alignment score: 837.0 (LEN: 861, IDY: 97.21), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 1027.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 7574
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1053 out of 8627 non-N bases (12.21%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8627 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1053
