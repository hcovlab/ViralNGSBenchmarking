CONTIG: None (4349bp)
Best alignment score: 2994.7 (LEN: 3036, IDY: 98.64), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 3589.7, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 702
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 777 1109 | 1 327 | 333 327 | 99.08 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1656 4697 | 868 3903 | 3042 3036 | 98.64 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
