CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8625bp)
Best alignment score: 840.1 (LEN: 862, IDY: 97.46), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 1621.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 6978
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1647 out of 8625 non-N bases (19.10%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8625 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1647
