CONTIG: None (8595bp)
Best alignment score: 5389.8 (LEN: 5412, IDY: 99.59), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8393.7, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 166
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5430 | 1 5412 | 5430 5412 | 99.59 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -166 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 5597 8625 | 5579 8595 | 3029 3017 | 99.73 | EMBOSS_001 None
