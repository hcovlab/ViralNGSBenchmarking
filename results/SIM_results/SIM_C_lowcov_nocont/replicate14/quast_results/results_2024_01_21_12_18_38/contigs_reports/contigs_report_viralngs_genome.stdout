			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8416.7, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 151
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 3 3831 | 3 3831 | 3829 3829 | 99.84 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -147 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 3981 8607 | 3981 8595 | 4627 4615 | 99.65 | EMBOSS_001 None
