CONTIG: None (8716bp)
Best alignment score: 6409.1 (LEN: 6440, IDY: 99.52), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8216.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 452
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 6452 | 1 6440 | 6452 6440 | 99.52 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6576 6916 | 6558 6895 | 341 338 | 99.7 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
