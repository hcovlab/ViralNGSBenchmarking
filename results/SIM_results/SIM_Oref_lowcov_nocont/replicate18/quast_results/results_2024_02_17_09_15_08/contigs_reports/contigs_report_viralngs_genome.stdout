CONTIG: None (8686bp)
Best alignment score: 4951.6 (LEN: 4968, IDY: 99.67), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8299.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 344
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 257 | 1 257 | 257 257 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 363 5339 | 363 5330 | 4977 4968 | 99.67 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
