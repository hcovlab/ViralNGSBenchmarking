CONTIG: None (8686bp)
Best alignment score: 3895.1 (LEN: 3897, IDY: 99.95), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8191.0, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 472
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 3897 | 1 3897 | 3897 3897 | 99.95 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 4146 5597 | 4146 5588 | 1452 1443 | 99.93 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 3 (local)
