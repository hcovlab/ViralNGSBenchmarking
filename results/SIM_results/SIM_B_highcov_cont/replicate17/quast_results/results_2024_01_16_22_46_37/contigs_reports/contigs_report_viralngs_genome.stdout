CONTIG: None (8608bp)
Best alignment score: 3972.4 (LEN: 3998, IDY: 99.36), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8240.6, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 301
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 4 386 | 4 386 | 383 383 | 99.74 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 523 4463 | 523 4448 | 3941 3926 | 99.24 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
