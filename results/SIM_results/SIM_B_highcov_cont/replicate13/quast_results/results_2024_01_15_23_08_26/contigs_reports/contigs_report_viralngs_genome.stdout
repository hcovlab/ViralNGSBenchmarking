CONTIG: None (8599bp)
Best alignment score: 4882.8 (LEN: 5062, IDY: 96.46), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7048.7, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 1338
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 7261 out of 8009 non-N bases (90.66%))
			Real Alignment 1: 885 5979 | 879 5940 | 5095 5062 | 96.46 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 9 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6283 8014 | 6235 7966 | 1732 1732 | 98.84 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 8181 8650 | 8133 8599 | 470 467 | 99.36 | EMBOSS_001 None
