CONTIG: None (8519bp)
Best alignment score: 4232.8 (LEN: 4276, IDY: 98.99), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8071.7, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 346
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 7 4291 | 7 4282 | 4285 4276 | 98.99 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 4453 4700 | 4444 4691 | 248 248 | 97.98 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 4875 8538 | 4866 8514 | 3664 3649 | 98.82 | EMBOSS_001 None
