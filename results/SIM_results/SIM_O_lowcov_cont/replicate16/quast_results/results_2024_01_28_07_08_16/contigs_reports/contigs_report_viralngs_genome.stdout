CONTIG: None (5811bp)
Best alignment score: 2329.0 (LEN: 2332, IDY: 99.87), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4889.9, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 895
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 137 | 1 137 | 137 137 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 403 2737 | 409 2740 | 2335 2332 | 99.87 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -1 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 2902 4499 | 2906 4500 | 1598 1595 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
