CONTIG: currsample-currdate (8622bp)
Best alignment score: 705.2 (LEN: 731, IDY: 96.47), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 1115.2, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 7479
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 1143 out of 8622 non-N bases (13.26%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8622 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 1143
