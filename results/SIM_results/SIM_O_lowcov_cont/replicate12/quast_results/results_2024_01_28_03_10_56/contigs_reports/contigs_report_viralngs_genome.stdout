CONTIG: None (7162bp)
Best alignment score: 3733.0 (LEN: 3733, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5269.0, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 1878
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 143 | 1 143 | 143 143 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 392 1398 | 392 1398 | 1007 1007 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1546 5281 | 1558 5290 | 3736 3733 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 6 (local)
