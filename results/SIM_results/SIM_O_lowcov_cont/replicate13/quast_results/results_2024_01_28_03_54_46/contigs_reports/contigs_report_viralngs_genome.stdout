CONTIG: None (7166bp)
Best alignment score: 3731.0 (LEN: 3731, IDY: 100.00), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5511.0, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1635
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 143 | 1 143 | 143 143 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 384 1391 | 390 1397 | 1008 1008 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1541 5277 | 1559 5289 | 3737 3731 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
