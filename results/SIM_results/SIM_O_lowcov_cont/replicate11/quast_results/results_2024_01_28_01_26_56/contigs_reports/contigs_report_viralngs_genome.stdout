CONTIG: None (5272bp)
Best alignment score: 2537.9 (LEN: 2595, IDY: 97.80), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4404.9, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 788
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 145 | 1 145 | 145 145 | 98.62 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 383 1328 | 389 1334 | 946 946 | 99.68 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1540 2337 | 1558 2355 | 798 798 | 99.75 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
