CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8625bp)
Best alignment score: 415.1 (LEN: 422, IDY: 98.36), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 827.1, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 7788
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 837 out of 8625 non-N bases (9.70%))
			Warning! This contig is more unaligned than misassembled. Contig length is 8625 (number of Ns: 0) and total length of all aligns is 837
