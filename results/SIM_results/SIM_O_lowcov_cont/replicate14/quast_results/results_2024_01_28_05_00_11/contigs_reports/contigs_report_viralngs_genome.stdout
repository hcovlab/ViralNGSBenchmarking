CONTIG: None (4608bp)
Best alignment score: 2927.8 (LEN: 2958, IDY: 98.98), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4023.8, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 526
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 681 958 | 1 278 | 278 278 | 98.56 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 3 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1127 1399 | 444 716 | 273 273 | 99.63 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1583 4543 | 912 3869 | 2961 2958 | 98.98 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
