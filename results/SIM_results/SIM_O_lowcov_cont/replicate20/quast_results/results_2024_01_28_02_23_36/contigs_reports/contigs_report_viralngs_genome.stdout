CONTIG: None (7165bp)
Best alignment score: 3713.9 (LEN: 3715, IDY: 99.97), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5444.9, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 1699
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 111 | 1 111 | 111 111 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -3 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 387 1401 | 390 1395 | 1015 1006 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1551 5271 | 1557 5271 | 3721 3715 | 99.97 | EMBOSS_001 None
