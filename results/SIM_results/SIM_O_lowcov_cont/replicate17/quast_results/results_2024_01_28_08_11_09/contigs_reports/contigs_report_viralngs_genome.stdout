CONTIG: None (5280bp)
Best alignment score: 2606.0 (LEN: 2617, IDY: 99.58), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4183.7, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 1066
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 105 | 1 105 | 105 105 | 100.0 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 389 1280 | 395 1283 | 892 889 | 99.52 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -12 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 1650 4275 | 1665 4281 | 2626 2617 | 99.58 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
