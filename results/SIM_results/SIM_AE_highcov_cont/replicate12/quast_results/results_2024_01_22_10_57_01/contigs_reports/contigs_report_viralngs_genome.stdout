CONTIG: None (8614bp)
Best alignment score: 6442.8 (LEN: 6531, IDY: 98.65), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8336.7, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 163
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 4 6546 | 4 6534 | 6543 6531 | 98.65 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -157 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6707 8635 | 6695 8614 | 1929 1920 | 98.9 | EMBOSS_001 None
