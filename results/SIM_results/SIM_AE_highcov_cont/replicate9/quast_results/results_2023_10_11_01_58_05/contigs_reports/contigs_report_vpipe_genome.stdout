CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8652bp)
Best alignment score: 6250.2 (LEN: 6357, IDY: 98.32), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8040.4, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 432
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 6379 | 1 6357 | 6379 6357 | 98.32 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -206 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6687 8554 | 6683 8545 | 1868 1863 | 97.38 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
