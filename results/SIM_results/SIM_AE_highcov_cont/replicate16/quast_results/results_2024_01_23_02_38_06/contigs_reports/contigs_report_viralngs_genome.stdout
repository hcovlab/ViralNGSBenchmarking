CONTIG: None (8617bp)
Best alignment score: 7917.2 (LEN: 7965, IDY: 99.40), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8423.2, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 138
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 526 | 1 514 | 526 514 | 99.42 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -102 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 650 8647 | 635 8599 | 7998 7965 | 99.4 | EMBOSS_001 None
