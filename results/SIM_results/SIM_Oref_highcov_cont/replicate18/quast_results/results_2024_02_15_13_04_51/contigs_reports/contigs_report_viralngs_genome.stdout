CONTIG: None (8677bp)
Best alignment score: 5979.4 (LEN: 6004, IDY: 99.59), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8401.3, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 228
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 6013 | 1 6004 | 6013 6004 | 99.59 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -228 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6257 8707 | 6233 8677 | 2451 2445 | 99.26 | EMBOSS_001 None
