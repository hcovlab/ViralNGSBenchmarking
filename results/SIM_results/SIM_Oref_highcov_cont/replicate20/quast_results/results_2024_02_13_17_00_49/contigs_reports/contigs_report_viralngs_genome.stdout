CONTIG: None (8698bp)
Best alignment score: 5282.9 (LEN: 5293, IDY: 99.81), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8409.8, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 245
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5314 | 1 5293 | 5314 5293 | 99.81 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -245 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 5560 8719 | 5539 8698 | 3160 3160 | 99.11 | EMBOSS_001 None
