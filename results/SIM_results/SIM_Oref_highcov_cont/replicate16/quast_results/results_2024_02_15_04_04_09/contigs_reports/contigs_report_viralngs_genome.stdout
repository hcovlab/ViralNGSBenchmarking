			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8339.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 226
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 4297 | 1 4285 | 4297 4285 | 97.62 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -211 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 4509 8713 | 4497 8683 | 4205 4187 | 99.38 | EMBOSS_001 None
