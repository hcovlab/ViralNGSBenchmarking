CONTIG: None (8686bp)
Best alignment score: 5690.7 (LEN: 5830, IDY: 97.61), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8226.4, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 186
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5857 | 1 5830 | 5857 5830 | 97.61 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -186 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6047 8719 | 6017 8686 | 2673 2670 | 95.16 | EMBOSS_001 None
