CONTIG: None (8491bp)
Best alignment score: 7742.1 (LEN: 7781, IDY: 99.50), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8218.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 227
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 125 7932 | 125 7905 | 7808 7781 | 99.5 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 8036 8518 | 8009 8491 | 483 483 | 99.59 | EMBOSS_001 None
