CONTIG: None (8672bp)
Best alignment score: 5052.8 (LEN: 5091, IDY: 99.25), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8406.4, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 197
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5094 | 1 5091 | 5094 5091 | 99.25 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -186 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 5292 8681 | 5289 8672 | 3390 3384 | 99.25 | EMBOSS_001 None
