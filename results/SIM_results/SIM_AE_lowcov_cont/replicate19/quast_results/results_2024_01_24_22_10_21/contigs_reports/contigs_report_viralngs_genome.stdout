CONTIG: None (8580bp)
Best alignment score: 2382.2 (LEN: 2447, IDY: 97.35), Total number of alignments: 4
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 4 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 4454.1, number of alignments: 4, unaligned bases: 4033
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 4547 out of 6640 non-N bases (68.48%))
			Real Alignment 1: 35 1195 | 1 1161 | 1161 1161 | 99.22 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 1356 2030 | 1322 1996 | 675 675 | 99.7 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 9 (local)
