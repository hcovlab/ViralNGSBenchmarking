CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8650bp)
Best alignment score: 5782.4 (LEN: 5829, IDY: 99.20), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8176.1, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 357
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5839 | 1 5829 | 5839 5829 | 99.2 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -10 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6026 8489 | 6019 8482 | 2464 2464 | 97.15 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
