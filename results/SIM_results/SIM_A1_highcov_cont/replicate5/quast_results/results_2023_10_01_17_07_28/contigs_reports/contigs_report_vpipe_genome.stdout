CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8638bp)
Best alignment score: 5792.0 (LEN: 5817, IDY: 99.57), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8303.4, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 208
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5833 | 1 5817 | 5833 5817 | 99.57 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -162 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6020 8623 | 6007 8619 | 2604 2613 | 97.03 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
