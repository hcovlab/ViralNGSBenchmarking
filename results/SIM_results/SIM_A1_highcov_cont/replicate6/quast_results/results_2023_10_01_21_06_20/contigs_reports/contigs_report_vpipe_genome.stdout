CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8641bp)
Best alignment score: 5765.3 (LEN: 5820, IDY: 99.06), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8254.7, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 208
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5842 | 1 5820 | 5842 5820 | 99.06 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -162 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6029 8632 | 6010 8622 | 2604 2613 | 96.19 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
