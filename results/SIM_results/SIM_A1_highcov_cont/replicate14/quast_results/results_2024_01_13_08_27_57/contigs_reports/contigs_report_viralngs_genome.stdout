CONTIG: None (8620bp)
Best alignment score: 3979.2 (LEN: 4148, IDY: 95.93), Total number of alignments: 3
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 3 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8006.2, number of alignments: 3, unaligned bases: 340
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 2 499 | 1 498 | 498 498 | 97.79 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 6 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 686 4325 | 679 4312 | 3640 3634 | 97.69 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
