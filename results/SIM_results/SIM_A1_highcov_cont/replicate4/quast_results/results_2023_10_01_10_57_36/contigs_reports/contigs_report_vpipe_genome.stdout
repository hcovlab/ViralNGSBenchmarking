CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8643bp)
Best alignment score: 5795.0 (LEN: 5820, IDY: 99.57), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8331.2, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 210
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5836 | 1 5820 | 5836 5820 | 99.57 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -162 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6029 8629 | 6010 8622 | 2601 2613 | 97.98 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
