CONTIG: currsample_currdate (8632bp)
Best alignment score: 5780.8 (LEN: 5811, IDY: 99.48), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8183.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 359
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5848 | 1 5811 | 5848 5811 | 99.48 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = -10 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 6035 8484 | 6001 8462 | 2450 2462 | 97.57 | EMBOSS_001 currsample_currdate
