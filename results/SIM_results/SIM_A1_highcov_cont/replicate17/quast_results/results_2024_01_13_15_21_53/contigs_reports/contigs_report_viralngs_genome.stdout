CONTIG: None (8630bp)
Best alignment score: 5836.3 (LEN: 5930, IDY: 98.42), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 8319.6, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 163
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 5939 | 1 5930 | 5939 5930 | 98.42 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = -163 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 6103 8648 | 6094 8630 | 2546 2537 | 98.08 | EMBOSS_001 None
