CONTIG: None (8621bp)
Best alignment score: 3582.8 (LEN: 3590, IDY: 99.80), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 5394.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 3124
		This contig is misassembled.
		This contig is partially unaligned. (Aligned 5497 out of 8290 non-N bases (66.31%))
			Real Alignment 1: 1 3596 | 1 3590 | 3596 3590 | 99.8 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 3722 5646 | 3716 5622 | 1925 1907 | 95.24 | EMBOSS_001 None
		Unaligned bases: 3124
