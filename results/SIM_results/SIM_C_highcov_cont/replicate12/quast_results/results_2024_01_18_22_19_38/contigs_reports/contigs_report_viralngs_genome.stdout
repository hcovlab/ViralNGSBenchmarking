CONTIG: None (8598bp)
Best alignment score: 4074.4 (LEN: 4131, IDY: 98.63), Total number of alignments: 5
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 5 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 7679.4, number of alignments: 5, unaligned bases: 783
		This contig is misassembled.
			Real Alignment 1: 1 632 | 1 629 | 632 629 | 99.04 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 2: 767 4912 | 764 4894 | 4146 4131 | 98.63 | EMBOSS_001 None
			  Scaffold gap between these two alignments, gap lengths difference (reference vs assembly) = 0 (local)
			Real Alignment 3: 5043 5363 | 5025 5342 | 321 318 | 99.69 | EMBOSS_001 None
